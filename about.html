        <p># About LetsRace.cc</p>
<p></p>
<p>Welcome to <strong>LetsRace.cc</strong> – your go-to source for youth cycling events across the UK.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Whether you’re a young rider, a parent, or a club coach, our goal is simple:  </p>
<p><strong>to make it easier to find, share and support youth cycling events in your region.</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>We curate listings from British Cycling and beyond – covering everything from <strong>road races and track meets</strong> to <strong>BMX, cyclo-cross, MTB, time trials, hill climbs</strong>, and more. You’ll find upcoming races, locations, and entry links, all in one place.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p>## Why we built this</p>
<p></p>
<p>Youth cycling is thriving – but event information can be scattered and hard to track down, or buried in websites that are difficult to use. This site aims to solve that.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>LetsRace.cc</strong> was created to meet the need for:</p>
<p></p>
<p>- a clear view of upcoming events for young riders </p>
<p>- better visibility for grassroots clubs and race organisers  </p>
<p>- an easier way for families to plan and support their riders’ journeys  </p>
<p></p>
<p>---</p>
<p></p>
<p>## Who's behind LetsRace.cc</p>
<p></p>
<p>This site is built and maintained by a cycling coach and tech consultant with a deep passion for youth racing and grassroots sport.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I’ve spent years working with local clubs, supporting young riders, volunteering at grassroots bike races and taking my own kids around regional cycling events – all while helping organisations use technology to support learning and development of their staff or students. LetsRace.cc is a personal passion project that brings those worlds together: a simple, clean platform to help the next generation of cyclists go further.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you’ve got suggestions, corrections, or want to collaborate – I’d love to hear from you.</p>

<p></p>
<p>## What’s coming next</p>
<p></p>
<p>This site is just getting started. In the coming months, the plan is to:</p>
<p></p>
<p>- add <strong>regional filters</strong> so you can view events near you  </p>
<p>- offer <strong>weekly email updates</strong> with new listings  </p>
<p>- showcase <strong>local cycling businesses and sponsors</strong> in each region  </p>
