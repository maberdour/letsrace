# About

Youth cycling is thriving – but event information can be scattered and hard to track down, or buried in websites that are really difficult to use, particularly for those new to the sport. This site aims to solve that.

**LetsRace.cc** was created to meet the need for:
- a clear view of upcoming events for young riders across all disciplines and multiple governing bodies
- to enable grassroots clubs to publicise regional events to riders and help avoid clashes when planning new events
- an easier way for families to plan and support their riders' journeys.

## What can you find here?

The site currently curates listings from the British Cycling and Cycling Time Trials websites – covering everything from closed circuit road races and track meetings to BMX, cyclo-cross, MTB, cycle speedway, traffic-free time trials and hill climbs. Coming soon, Duathlon and Triathlon events will also be added, which is an area in which youth cyclists often excel and is great for their all-round development. You’ll find upcoming events, locations, and entry links, all in one place.
