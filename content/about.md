# About

Youth cycling is thriving – but event information can be scattered and hard to track down, or buried in websites that are really difficult to use, particularly for those new to the sport. 

**LetsRace.cc** provides a clear, easy to use directory of upcoming events for young riders across all cycling disciplines and multiple governing bodies

As well as an easier way for families to plan and support their riders' journeys, the site enables grassroots clubs to keep abreast of regional events that their riders might be interested in,  and can help avoid regional clashes when planning their own events.

## What can you find here?

The site currently curates listings from the British Cycling and Cycling Time Trials websites – covering everything from closed circuit road races and track meetings to BMX, cyclo-cross, MTB, cycle speedway, traffic-free time trials and hill climbs. Coming soon, Duathlon and Triathlon events will also be added, which is an area in which youth cyclists often excel and is great for their all-round development. You’ll find upcoming events, locations, and entry links, all in one place.  

## Contact
My name is Mark, I've been a youth cycling coach for 12 years, youth cycling club chair for 5 of those, and more recently an event organiser (National Youth Omnium, regional youth Duathlon and a local youth-only Hill Climb). Throughout that time, I've found that finding events for my own kids and club riders is a frustrating experience at best, and at worst it has not been uncommon to find out about great events after they've happened. I'm a software engineer by trade, so built this as a personal project to solve that problem. I hope you find it useful!
