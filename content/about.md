# About
Welcome to **LetsRace.cc** – your go-to source for youth cycling events across the UK.
Whether you’re a young rider, a parent, or a club coach, the goal is simple: **to make it easier to find, share and support youth cycling events in your region.**
This site curates listings from the British Cycling and Cycling Time Trials websites – covering everything from closed circuit road races and track meetings to BMX, cyclo-cross, MTB, cycle speedway, traffic-free time trials and hill climbs. You’ll find upcoming races, locations, and entry links, all in one place.  Also coming soon, Duathlon and Triathlon will be added, as youth cyclists can excel at these events and the additional run and swim disciplines are great for their all-round development. 

## Why is this site needed?
Youth cycling is thriving – but event information can be scattered and hard to track down, or buried in websites that are really difficult to use, particularly for those new to the sport. This site aims to solve that.
**LetsRace.cc** was created to meet the need for:
- a clear view of upcoming events for young riders across all disciplines and multiple governing bodies
- better visibility for grassroots clubs and race organisers, particularly to help avoid clashes when planning new events
- an easier way for families to plan and support their riders' journeys.

## What's coming next
This site is being updated regularly. If you've got an idea for how to improve it, please email:** [hello@letsrace.cc](mailto:hello@letsrace.cc)
