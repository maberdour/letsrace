# Road
This category covers closed circuits and town centre criteriums, raced on road bikes with brakes and (usually) multiple gears.

# Track
This category covers track races on velodromes, raced on track bikes with no brakes. Most races require riders to be track accredited, check with organiser if in doubt.

# MTB
This category covers all types of Mountain Bike races.

# BMX
This category covers all types of BMX bike races, typically raced on purpose-built BMX tracks. 

# Cyclo-Cross

# About
Welcome to LetsRace.cc – your go-to source for youth cycling events across the UK. Whether you’re a young rider, a parent, or a club coach, the goal is simple: to make it easier to find, share and support youth cycling events in your region. This site curates listings from British Cycling and beyond – covering everything from road races and track meets to BMX, cyclo-cross, MTB, time trials, hill climbs, and more. You’ll find upcoming races, locations, and entry links, all in one place.
## Why is this site needed?
Youth cycling is thriving – but event information can be scattered and hard to track down, or buried in websites that are really difficult to use, particularly for those new to the sport. This site aims to solve that. LetsRace.cc was created to meet the need for:
- a clear view of upcoming events for young riders
- better visibility for grassroots clubs and race organisers
- an easier way for families to plan and support their riders' journeys.
