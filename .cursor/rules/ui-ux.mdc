# UI/UX Guidelines

## Design Principles
- Clean, modern interface focused on youth cycling events
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Fast loading and performance optimized
- Accessible to all users

## Layout Standards
- H1 headings should be left aligned across all pages
- Footer should be specified in one place rather than hardcoded on every page
- Use consistent spacing and typography
- Maintain visual hierarchy with proper heading structure

## Color Scheme
- Use Tailwind CSS color palette
- Category-specific colors for event types (e.g., bg-category-hillclimb)
- Dark mode support with proper contrast
- Consistent use of neutral colors for text and backgrounds

## User Experience
- Clear navigation between event categories
- Easy filtering by region and event type
- Fast search and filtering capabilities
- Intuitive event information display
- Responsive design for all device sizes

## Performance
- Implement caching for better performance
- Optimize images and assets
- Use service workers for offline functionality
- Minimize HTTP requests

## Performance Optimization Standards
- Homepage load time target: Under 0.5 second
- Event page load time target: Under 0.5 seconds
- Inline critical CSS for immediate page rendering
- Defer non-critical JavaScript until after page load
- Use DNS prefetch and preconnect for external resources
- Implement smart caching with 23-hour expiry for event data
- Limit concurrent API requests to prevent overload (max 2 concurrent)
- Use debounced input handling (200ms) for better performance
- Implement progressive enhancement approach
- Use service workers for offline functionality

## Loading Sequence Standards
1. Critical content first (header, footer, main data)
2. Non-critical content deferred (analytics, service worker)
3. Background preloading after main content loads
4. Limited concurrency to prevent API overload

## Network Optimization
- DNS prefetch for external domains
- Preconnect for faster connection establishment
- High priority requests for main content
- Reduced timeouts for faster fallbacks (5s for main content, 10s for preloading)

## User Experience Standards
- No loading message flash - basic page structure appears instantly
- Clear feedback for empty states ("No upcoming events found")
- Preserve region parameters across navigation
- URL state management for filter persistence
- Graceful error handling with helpful messages
- Responsive design for all device sizes
- Fast search and filtering capabilities
- Intuitive event information display

## Analytics and Tracking
- Automatic tracking of filter changes
- Event click tracking (if Plausible is available)
- No tracking without user consent
- Production-only analytics loading to prevent local file:// errors
