#About LetsRace.cc

Welcome to LetsRace.cc – your go-to source for youth cycling events across the UK.

Whether you’re a young rider, a parent, or a club coach, our goal is simple:
to make it easier to find, share and support youth cycling events in your region.

We curate listings from British Cycling and beyond – covering everything from road races and track meets to BMX, cyclo-cross, MTB, time trials, hill climbs, and more. You’ll find upcoming races, locations, and  entry links, all in one place.

#Why we built this

Youth cycling is thriving – but event information can be scattered and hard to track down, or buried in websites that are difficult to use. We wanted to solve that.

LetsRace.cc was created due to the need for:
   •   a clear national view of upcoming events for young riders
   •   better visibility for grassroots clubs and race organisers
   •   an easier way for families to plan and support their riders’ journeys

#What’s coming next

We’re just getting started. In the coming months, we plan to:
   •   add regional filters so you can view events near you
   •   offer weekly email updates with new listings
   •   showcase local cycling businesses and sponsors in each region

If you have an idea about how to improve the site, we’d love to hear from you.
