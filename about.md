# About LetsRace.cc

Welcome to **LetsRace.cc** – your go-to source for youth cycling events across the UK.

Whether you’re a young rider, a parent, or a club coach, our goal is simple:  
**to make it easier to find, share and support youth cycling events in your region.**

We curate listings from British Cycling and beyond – covering everything from **road races and track meets** to **BMX, cyclo-cross, MTB, time trials, hill climbs**, and more. You’ll find upcoming races, locations, and entry links, all in one place.

## Why we built this

Youth cycling is thriving – but event information can be scattered and hard to track down, or buried in websites that are difficult to use. This site aims to solve that.

**LetsRace.cc** was created to meet the need for:

- a clear view of upcoming events for young riders 
- better visibility for grassroots clubs and race organisers  
- an easier way for families to plan and support their riders’ journeys

## Who's behind LetsRace.cc

This site is built and maintained by a cycling coach and tech consultant with a deep passion for youth racing and grassroots sport.

I’ve spent years working with local clubs, supporting young riders, volunteering at grassroots bike races and taking my own kids around regional cycling events – all while helping organisations use technology to support learning and development of their staff or students. LetsRace.cc is a personal passion project that brings those worlds together: a simple, clean platform to help the next generation of cyclists go further.

If you’ve got suggestions, corrections, or want to collaborate – I’d love to hear from you.

## What’s coming next

This site is just getting started. In the coming months, the plan is to:

- add **regional filters** so you can view events near you  
- offer **weekly email updates** with new listings  
- showcase **local cycling businesses and sponsors** in each region
