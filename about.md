# About LetsRace.cc
Welcome to **LetsRace.cc** – your go-to source for youth cycling events across the UK.
Whether you’re a young rider, a parent, or a club coach, the goal is simple: **to make it easier to find, share and support youth cycling events in your region.**
This site curates listings from British Cycling and beyond – covering everything from **road races and track meets** to **BMX, cyclo-cross, MTB, time trials, hill climbs**, and more. You’ll find upcoming races, locations, and entry links, all in one place.
## Why is this site needed?
Youth cycling is thriving – but event information can be scattered and hard to track down, or buried in websites that are really difficult to use, particularly for those new to the sport. This site aims to solve that.
**LetsRace.cc** was created to meet the need for:
- a clear view of upcoming events for young riders 
- better visibility for grassroots clubs and race organisers  
- an easier way for families to plan and support their riders’ journeys.
## Who's behind LetsRace.cc
My name is Mark. I am a youth cycling coach and technology with a deep passion for youth racing and grassroots sport. I’ve spent years working with local clubs, supporting young riders, volunteering at grassroots bike races and taking my own kids around regional cycling events. My day job is helping organisations use technology to develop the skills of their staff or students. LetsRace.cc is a personal passion project that brings those worlds together: a simple, clean platform to help the next generation of cyclists go further.
If you’ve got suggestions or corrections – I’d love to hear from you.
